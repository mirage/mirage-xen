(** Event channels interface. *)

type handle
(** An initialised event channel interface. *)

type t
(** A local event channel. *)

val to_int : t -> int
(** [to_int evtchn] is the port number of [evtchn]. *)

val of_int : int -> t
(** [of_int n] is the [n]th event channel. *)

val init : unit -> handle
(** Return an initialised event channel interface. On error it will throw a
    Failure exception. *)

val close : handle -> int
(** Close an event channel interface and return the status code. *)

val notify : handle -> t -> unit
(** Notify the given event channel. On error it will throw a Failure exception. *)

val bind_interdomain : handle -> int -> int -> t
(** [bind_interdomain h domid remote_port] returns a local event channel
    connected to domid:remote_port. On error it will throw a Failure exception. *)

val bind_unbound_port : handle -> int -> t
(** [bind_unbound_port h remote_domid] returns a new event channel awaiting an
    interdomain connection from [remote_domid]. On error it will throw a Failure
    exception. *)

val bind_dom_exc_virq : handle -> t
(** Binds a local event channel to the VIRQ_DOM_EXC (domain exception VIRQ). On
    error it will throw a Failure exception. *)

val unbind : handle -> t -> unit
(** Unbinds the given event channel. On error it will throw a Failure exception. *)

val unmask : handle -> t -> unit
(** Unmasks the given event channel. On error it will throw a Failure exception. *)

val is_valid : t -> bool
(** [is_valid c] is true if [t] is bound. Bindings are invalidated after a
    domain resume. *)
