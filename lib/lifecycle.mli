(** [await_shutdown_request ()] is thread that resolves when the domain is asked
    to shut down. The optional [poweroff] (default:[true]) and [reboot]
    (default:[false]) arguments can be used to indicate which features the
    caller wants to advertise (however, you can still get a request for a mode
    you didn't claim to support). *)
