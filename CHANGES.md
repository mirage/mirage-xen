## v6.0.0 (2020-10-20)

Version 6.0.0 is a re-write of the MirageOS Xen platform stack, with the
overall goal of replacing Mini-OS and moving to a minimal, legacy-free codebase
which builds MirageOS unikernels as Xen PVHv2 domUs only. At the same time,
this change aligns the Xen backend with existing Solo5 backends as much as is
practical and replaces the OCaml runtime with that provided by
ocaml-freestanding.

This is a breaking change. MirageOS libraries and applications that make use of
Xen-specific APIs will need to be updated. See below for a list of the
interfaces that have changed.

Requirements changes:

* OCaml 4.08 or later and Dune 2.6 or later are required.
* Xen version 4.10 or later is required, as this is the earliest version which
  provides production-quality and stable PVHv2 APIs.
* Additionally, the custom Xen version 4.8 used by Qubes OS 4.0 is supported,
  as this has enough of PVHv2 backported to it.
* Only x86\_64 hosts with HAP (EPT) are supported. Support for ARM32 has been
  removed. Support for ARM64 may be added at a later date if there is interest.

Security posture improvements:

With the move to a Solo5 and ocaml-freestanding base MirageOS gains several
notable improvements to security posture for unikernels on Xen:

* Stack smashing protection is enabled unconditionally for all C code.
* W^X is enforced throughout, i.e. `.text` is read-execute, `.rodata` is
  read-only, non-executable and `.data`, heap and stack are read-write and
  non-executable.
* The memory allocator used by the OCaml runtime is now dlmalloc (provided by
  ocaml-freestanding), which is a big improvement over the Mini-OS malloc, and
  incorporates features such as heap canaries.

Interface changes:

* The `Eventchn` and `Generation` modules, previously provided by `xen-evtchn`
  have been folded into `mirage-xen` as `OS.Eventchn` and `OS.Generation`
  respectively.  Applications and libraries should replace any dependency on
  `xen-evtchn` with one on `mirage-xen {>= "6.0.0"}` and use the corresponding
  submodules in `OS` directly.
* The `OS.MM` module has been replaced with a new `OS.Memory` module, with a
  statistics interface modeled after stdlib's `Gc` stat type. All units use the
  system word size rather than pages, which were ill-defined.
* `OS.Sched` has been removed. These interfaces (notably domain suspend/resume)
  were present but never fully implemented in the old Xen stack.  They are not
  required for PVH domains or full-system suspend/resume and
  applications/libraries should remove any calls to them.
* `OS.Start_info` has been removed. These interfaces were specific to Xen PV,
  and don't have a direct equivalent for PVH domains.
* `OS.Xenctrl` has been removed. There are no known users of these interfaces,
  which appear to be a left-over from earlier versions of the Xen stack.
* `OS.Xen.virt_to_mfn` has been removed. This is a little-used low-level
  vestige of Mini-OS, and in the Solo5-based virtual memory arrangement should
  be replaced with the equivalent computation (`addr >> 12`) in application
  code directly.

Dependency changes:

* Now depends on `solo5-bindings-xen` (for the low-level VCPU initialisation
  and startup) and `ocaml-freestanding` (for the OCaml runtime). It follows
  that `-freestanding` variants of existing packages such as `zarith` and `gmp`
  are used instead of `-xen` variants.
* The `io-page-xen` package is no longer used. Applications/libraries depending
  on it should replace the dependency with one on `io-page`.
* As mentioned above, the `xen-evtchn` package is no longer used and
  applications/libraries should replace their dependency with one on
  `mirage-xen {>= "6.0.0"}`.

C stubs changes:

* `alloc_pages_stubs.c`: added, provides stubs for `Io_page`, as in `mirage-solo5`.
* `checksum_stubs.c`: added, provides stubs for `Tcpip`, as in `mirage-solo5`.
* `exit_stubs.c`: removed, equivalent provided by `ocaml-freestanding`.
* `sched_stubs.c`: removed, no longer required.
* `start_info_stubs.c`: removed, no longer required.
* `xb_stubs.c`: removed, no users and no longer required.

Apart from the above, the majority of C stubs which are used by `mirage-xen`
have been renamed to follow the `mirage_xen_XXX` rather than `stub_XXX`
convention.

The low-level C interfaces to Xen event channels (`evtchn.c`) and grant tables
(`gnttab.c`) have been re-written from scratch. Some additional interfaces have
been added to `main.c` to replace functionality that was previously part of
`start_info_stubs.c` (obtaining initial PV console and Xenstore ports and I/O
rings from Xen).

Due to issues with mixing PIC and non-PIC code when compiling the C stubs with
Dune, the build system has been adapted to use a foreign Makefile for
`libmirage-xen_bindings.a`. This is the recommended method to use when building
libraries containing C code for use with MirageOS. See conversation in #23 for
details.

Relationship with the Solo5 Xen bindings:

For Xen, Solo5 only provides the initial PVH boot, VCPU setup/traps and C-side
PV console code. Some Mirage-internal private APIs are provided to allow
`mirage-xen` to interact with the hypervisor -- this is fully explained in
Solo5 commit Solo5/solo5@f4b47d1 and follow-ups.

* Fix mirage-xen pkg-config file to reflect correct location of
  the bindings (@avsm)

## v4.0.0 (2019-06-25)

* Breaking change: move from the `OS.Xen` module to `Os_xen`, in
  order to let packages specifically depend on a particular bit
  of Xen functionality. To port code, just change the module reference
  to `Os_xen` instead of `OS`. (#16 @TheLortex @avsm)

## v3.4.0 (2019-04-22)

* update to opam2

## 3.0.6 (2018-03-13)

* separated from mirage-platform into a custom repository, mirage-xen

## 3.0.5 (2017-11-19)

* xen: add support for OCaml 4.05.0 (@talex5, #195)

## 3.0.4 (2017-07-14)

* remove support for versions of OCaml older than 4.04.2, and add support
  for OCaml 4.04.2.  For older revisions of OCaml, use an older revision of
  mirage-xen-ocaml.

## 3.0.3 (2017-06-16)
* xen: we need io-page-xen because
  - mirage-xen depends on xen-gnt (for suspend/resume callbacks)
  - xen-gnt depends on io-page (to represent the types of page mappings)
  - io-page needs either io-page-unix or io-page-xen. We can't hardcode
    a dependency because it needs to be different on Unix / Xen / Solo5.
    In future we could break the link by adding some kind of `pre suspend`
    `post resume` callback mechanism and then remove the `xen-gnt` dependency.

* unix: we need io-page-unix because
  - mirage-types-lwt is in the `common` set linked into all Unikernels by
    the `mirage` tool
  - mirage-types-lwt depends on `mirage-block-lwt` and `mirage-net-lwt`
  - mirage-block-lwt depends on io-page
  - io-page needs either io-page-unix or io-page-xen. We can't hardcode
    a dependency because it needs to be different on Unix / Xen / Solo5
    In future we could break the link by rethinking the alignment requirements
    of the interfaces. Perhaps FLOW could be unaligned but raw NETIF
    and BLOCKIF aligned?

## 3.0.2 (2017-06-16)

* Add generic hooks to mainloop to support background tasks. (#120)
* [xen] Report trace events for GC again; this was disabled temporarily
  in the 2.2.0 release. (#119)

## 2.2.1 (2015-01-26):
* Fix Xen compilation with `gcc 4.8+` by disabling the stack protector
  and `-fno-tree-loop-distribute-patterns` (not compatible with MiniOS).
  These missing flags were a regression from 2.1.3, which did include them.

## 2.2.0 (2015-01-23):

This releases adds support for OCaml 4.02+ compilation, and changes the Xen
backend build for Mirage significantly by:

* removing the OCaml compiler runtime from the mirage-platform, which makes
  it simpler to work across multiple revisions of the compiler.  It now uses
  the `ocaml-src` OPAM package to grab the current switch's version of the
  OCaml runtime.
* split the Xen runtime build into discrete `pkg-config` libraries:
  * `mirage-xen-posix.pc` : in the `xen-posix/` directory, is the nano-posix
     layer built with no knowledge of OCaml
  * `mirage-xen-minios.pc`: defines the `__INSIDE_MINIOS__` macro to expose
     internal state via the MiniOS headers (for use only by libraries that
     know exactly what they are doing with the MiniOS)
  * `mirage-xen-ocaml.pc`: in `xen-ocaml/core/`, this builds the OCaml asmrun,
     Bigarray and Str bindings using the `mirage-xen-posix` layer.
  * `mirage-xen-ocaml-bindings.pc`: in `xen-ocaml/bindings/`, these are bindings
     required by the OCaml libraries to MiniOS.  Some of the bindings use MiniOS
     external state and hence use `mirage-xen-minios`, whereas others
    (`cstruct_stubs` and `barrier_stubs` are just OCaml bindings and so just
    use `mirage-xen-posix`).
  * `mirage-xen.pc`: depends on all the above to provide the same external
    interface as the current `mirage-platform`.

The OCaml code is now built using OASIS, since the C code is built entirely
separately and could be moved out into a separate OPAM package entirely.

## 2.1.3 (2015-01-23):
* [xen] Fix error handling in `OS.Main.run` to enable a top-level
  exception to signal to the Xen toolstack that it crashed (versus a
  clean exit). This in turn lets `on_crash="preserve"` behaviour work
  better in Xen VM description files.
* Remove `mirage-xen.pc` file on uninstall.

## 2.1.2 (2014-12-20):

[xen] Updated headers and build for Mini-OS 0.5.  This involves:

* Require libminios >= 0.5
* Remove old includes directory when installing
* Compile with `-fno-builtin` (avoids warnings about standard functions)
* Removed `complex.h` (now provided by Openlibm)
* Include `cdefs.h` from `types.h` (needed for `__BEGIN_DECLS`)
* Removed open from `unistd.h` (comes from `fcntl.h`)
* Removed `assert.h` and `__assert_fail` (provided by Mini-OS)
* Removed `string.h` (provided by Mini-OS)
* Removed `cdefs.h` (provided by Mini-OS)
* Added missing `console.h` includes (for `printk`)

## 2.1.1 (2014-12-17):
* Remove checksum stubs from Unix and Xen, as they are provided by `tcpip` now.
* [xen] Define UINTx_MAX and SIZE_MAX in stdint.h

## 2.1.0 (2014-12-07):
* [xen] Report trace events for GC, block_domain, XenStore and event channels.
  This introduces a new dependency on the `mirage-profile` package.
* [xen] Install a `pkg-config` file to allow other projects to compile C stubs
  against `mirage-xen`.
* [xen] Remove duplication of OCaml header files inside the `include` tree.

## 2.0.1 (2014-12-05):
* [xen] Assert that pages passed to the grant share API are page-aligned.
  This always happens if they are created via `Io_page.create`, and
  probably not true if made by `Cstruct.create`.
* [xen] Use monotonic time for timing events, not wall-clock time.
* [xen] Provide functions that C code often uses for asserts (`abort`,
  `printf`, etc).

## 2.0.0 (2014-11-04):
* Remove dietlibc, libm and most of the include files, replacing them with
  external dependencies on Mini-OS and openlibm.
* Introduce Xen/ARM support that works with both Xen 4.4 and the 4.5dev
  hypervisor ABI.  Testing on Cubieboard2 and Cubietruck devices.
* [xen] Move the Xen main Lwt loop into OCaml code to simplify it (#99).
* Build fixes to work with multiple findlib directories in a single
  installation (#101 from Petter Urkedal).
* [xen] Install runtime headers for `mirage-xen` so that external C
  libraries can be compiled (#102 from James Bielman)
* [xen] Add support for demand-mapping for backend devices via a MiniOS
  gntmap device (#103).

## 1.1.1 (2013-02-24):
* xen: support 4096 event channels (up from 8). Each device typically
  uses one event channel.

## 1.1.0 (2013-02-01):
* Update to new io-page{,.unix} ocamlfind packages.
* Remove unused Netif module from Unix backend.
* Xen now depends on `xen-{evtchn,gnt}` packages.
* Add a `type 'a io` to make it easier to include with the Mirage sigs.

## 1.0.0 (2013-12-10):
* Set `Sys.os_type` to Unix in the Xen backend to help compatibility (#78).
* Suppress another dietlibc linker warning for vprintf in Xen.

## 0.9.9 (2013-12-07):
* Fix uninstall target for Unix.
* Remove `tuntap` stubs from Unix module; they are in `ocaml-tuntap` now.
* Move `OS.Clock` out to a toplevel `Clock` module (the `mirage-clock` package).
* Move `OS.Io_page` out to a toplevel `Io_page` module (the `io-page` package).
* Update library dependencies to reduce them based on new functionality.
* Install library as `mirage-xen` or `mirage-unix` that can coexist.
* Suppress dietlibc linker warnings for sscanf/sprintf.

## 0.9.8 (2013-11-07):
* Add support for OCaml 4.01.0 in addition to the existing 4.00.1 runtime.
* Major refresh of the NS3 simulation backend, for latest APIs.
* Add `Netif` statistics counters per-packet.
* [xen] Fix multi-page ring support by granting the correct data pages.
* [unix] flush OS.Console file descriptor more often (#108).
* Fix regression in `Io_page.string_blit` with non-zero src offset (#71).

## 0.9.7 (2013-10-05):
* Add Travis continuous integration scripts.
* [xen] zero out freshly allocated io pages.
* [xen] correct reattach xenstore connection after resume.
* [xen] fix suspend/resume
* [xen] switch to interrupts (SCHEDOP_block) rather than polling (SCHEDOP_poll)
  to allow more than 128 event channels
* [xen] add Activations.after interface to help drivers avoid losing interrupts
* Fix build on older gcc (4.4) versions, as found in CentOS 6.4.

## 0.9.6 (2013-08-27):
* [xen] adapt to new xenstore interface which allows the same code
  to be compiled under Unix userspace and xen kernelspace

## 0.9.5 (2013-08-09):
* Add the `mir-rt` regression runner to `scripts/` (not installed).
* Unhook `mir-run` from the build, as Mirari replaces it.
* [xen] Port Netif to use the `Macaddr` module from `ocaml-ipaddr`.

## 0.9.4 (2013-08-07):
* [xen] add atomic load/store bindings for shared memory rings
* [xen] add atomic operations necessary for vchan
* [xen] expose memory barriers via Xenctrl ocamlfind package

## 0.9.3 (2013-07-18):
* [xen] Prevent spinning in `Activations.run` when a thread is blocked
  and then awakened.
* [xen] Gnt.grant_table_index is now an int, was an int32.
* [xen] Cleaned some C stubs files, mainly page_stubs.c
* [xen] Improved module Netif: The function create do not take a
  callback anymore, hidden some private function from the .mli.
* [unix] Add support for building and running on FreeBSD.

## 0.9.2 (2013-07-09):
* [xen] Add Netif test to wait for a fixed number of ring slots > 0
* [xen] Add Evtchn.close to Xen backend.
* [xen] Disable tree-loop-distribute-patterns to workaround crash with
  gcc-4.8.  Temporary fix until we isolate the bug.
* [xen] Improved the interface of Io_page, implement some missing bits
  in Gnt.
* [xen] Several modules now have an interface similar to the one in
  the libxc bindings for OCaml. This makes it possible to write one
  application that can be compiled for the UNIX or the Xen backend.

## 0.9.1 (2013-06-11):
* [xen] add mmap stubs to make the default Bigarray module happy.
* OS.Netif.create no longer creates the tuntap interface.  Hotplug events
  are generated from the mirari calling functions instead, removing the
  policy from this library.

## 0.9.0 (2013-05-22):
* [xen] Add a simple 'resume hook' mechanism for xen devices
* [xen] Update to new shared ring signature in 0.4.0
* [xen] Allow device providers to be added later
* [xen] Move the blkif implementation to ocaml-xen-block-driver

* [xen] Console.write_s has been renamed Console.write_all
* [xen] Gnttab.unmap_exn now throws an exception on failure, like the
  xenctrl version. This makes it possible to run the same blkback code
  in kernelspace and userspace.

## 0.8.1 (2013-03-27):
* [xen] Fix the Xen block interface to wait for init correctly.

## 0.8.0 (2013-02-12):
* Remove `mir-build` script as the Mirari builder does its job now.
* [xen] add Str module C stubs, adapted to work in the Xen backend.

## 0.7.2 (2013-02-08):
* [xen] Fix the size of the start-of-day Xenstore and console rings.
* Quieten the verbosity of devices sleeping in Xen, to avoid console
  overflow situations.
* Install the packed `cmx` along with the `cmxa` to ensure that the
  compiler can do cross-module optimization (this is not a fatal error,
  but will impact performance if the `cmx` file is not present).

## 0.7.1 (2012-12-20):
* [unix] Update devices API to use Cstruct 0.6.0

## 0.7.0 (2012-12-20):
* [xen] Add support for VM suspend/resume/migrate
* [xen] Support for multiple network interfaces
* [xen] Use new shared-memory-ring, removing old builtin version.
  This is all OCaml except for the memory barrier assembly instructions.
* Update Cstruct to new API in 0.6.0

## 0.6.1 (2012-12-15):
* [xen] Add an unused ?dev parameter to Netif.create to match
  the UNIX version.
* [script] Add a mir-build script which converts a native output
  object into a Xen kernel.  It does command-line parsing to be
  compatible with other Xen outputs in the future (such as the
  kFreeBSD or Javascript backends, when they are ready).

## 0.6.0 (2012-12-11):
* [xen] refresh to ocaml-4.00.1 runtime.  You *must* use the
  correct OPAM switch to match versions, or bad things will
  happen when the resulting binary is run.

## 0.5.0 (2012-12-10):
* [xen] Fix spurious floating point exceptions on some machines.
* [ns3] Add NS3-based simulator backend.
* [unix] Add pcap-based Ethernet access in addition to tuntap.

## 0.4.1 (2012-11-04):
* [xen] fix incorrect reference counting in Io_pages that could
  potentially cause pages to be reused too early.
* [xen] move Xenstore protocol implementation out to a separate
  library that provides it as a functor.
* [unix] ignore SIGPIPE in the OS.Main.run function.

## 0.4.0 (2012-09-11):
* [xen] Add support for mapping and unmapping grant references
* [xen] Support Xen 4.2 reserved console and xenstore maps.
* [xen] Switch the Xenstore and console rings over to use cstruct.
